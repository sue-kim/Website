# Street Life Map

This project intends to propose a new way of visualizing the quality of urban street life by measuring the intensity of social life happens in the streets. The social life score will be calculated by several geo-spatial point (POI) data categories, for instance, catering, leisure, shop, tree cover ratio, etc. After that, each street will be scored base on its intensity of social life (the score will be calculated base on the kernel density) in a certain radius of walking distance. The website will not only visualize the attractiveness of each street by their social life sore but also provides more detail information of interestingness, safety, events in the street selected by users. The Streetlife map encourages citizens to explore the city by their everyday social life experience rather than purely searching for the shortest routes from one place to another.

# Emojiscape

A cityscape is difficult to digest. In the context of architectural engagement or interaction with our built environment, big data has the potential to hugely impact the way we rationalize urban-scale and architectural-scale decision making. When considering human-centric qualities such as perception or behavior, however, this is not nearly as explicitly quantifiable or straightforward to evaluate.
Emojiscape suggests that social media may help to transform civic policy making, alongside architectural needs and successes by dissecting and evaluating human perception. Using emotion analysis with data gathered from social media platformâ€”Instagram, Emojiscape develops experiments with the intention of bringing new value to architectural and civic narratives.
